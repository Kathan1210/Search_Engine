Our software testing tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.Software testing is widely used technology because it is compulsory to test each and every software before deployment.Our Software testing tutorial includes all topics of Software testing such as Methods such as Black Box Testing, White Box Testing, Visual Box Testing and Gray Box Testing. Levels such as Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Regression Testing, Functional Testing. System Testing, Acceptance Testing, Alpha Testing, Beta Testing, Non-Functional testing, Security Testing, Portability Testing.What is Software TestingSoftware testing is a process of identifying the correctness of software by considering its all attributes (Reliability, Scalability, Portability, Re-usability, Usability) and evaluating the execution of software components to find the software bugs or errors or defects.Software testing provides an independent view and objective of the software and gives surety of fitness of the software. It involves testing of all components under the required services to confirm that whether it is satisfying the specified requirements or not. The process is also providing the client with information about the quality of the software.Testing is mandatory because it will be a dangerous situation if the software fails any of time due to lack of testing. So, without testing software cannot be deployed to the end user.What is TestingTesting is a group of techniques to determine the correctness of the application under the predefined script but, testing cannot find all the defect of application. The main intent of testing is to detect failures of the application so that failures can be discovered and corrected. It does not demonstrate that a product functions properly under all conditions but only that it is not working in some specific conditions.Testing furnishes comparison that compares the behavior and state of software against mechanisms because the problem can be recognized by the mechanism. The mechanism may include past versions of the same specified product, comparable products, and interfaces of expected purpose, relevant standards, or other criteria but not limited up to these.Testing includes an examination of code and also the execution of code in various environments, conditions as well as all the examining aspects of the code. In the current scenario of software development, a testing team may be separate from the development team so that Information derived from testing can be used to correct the process of software development.The success of software depends upon acceptance of its targeted audience, easy graphical user interface, strong functionality load test, etc. For example, the audience of banking is totally different from the audience of a video game. Therefore, when an organization develops a software product, it can assess whether the software product will be beneficial to its purchasers and other audience.Type of Software testingWe have various types of testing available in the market, which are used to test the application or the software.With the help of below image, we can easily understand the type of software testing:Manual testingThe process of checking the functionality of an application as per the customer needs without taking any help of automation tools is known as manual testing. While performing the manual testing on any application, we do not need any specific knowledge of any testing tool, rather than have a proper understanding of the product so we can easily prepare the test document.Manual testing can be further divided into three types of testing, which are as follows:White box testing Black box testingGray box testingFor more information about manual testing, refers to the below link:https://www.javatpoint.com/manual-testingAutomation testingAutomation testing is a process of converting any manual test cases into the test scripts with the help of automation tools, or any programming language is known as automation testing. With the help of automation testing, we can enhance the speed of our test execution because here, we do not require any human efforts. We need to write a test script and execute those scripts.For more information about manual testing, refers to the below link:https://www.javatpoint.com/automation-testingPrerequisiteBefore learning software testing, you should have basic knowledge of basic computer functionality, basic mathematics, computer language, and logical operators.AudienceOur software testing tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.ProblemsWe assure that you will not find any problem in this Software Testing Tutorial.
