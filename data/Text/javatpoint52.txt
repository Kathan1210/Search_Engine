The significant components of Computer organization are ALU, CPU, memory and memory organization.PrerequisiteBefore learning the concepts of Computer Architecture and Organization, you should have a basic knowledge prior to Computer Architecture, basic functional units of a computer system, etc.AudienceOur COA tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.ProblemWe can assure you that you will not find any problem in this tutorial.
