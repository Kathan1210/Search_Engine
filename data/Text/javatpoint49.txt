?Operating System TutorialOperating System Tutorial provides the basic and advanced concepts of operating system . Our Operating system tutorial is designed for beginners, professionals and GATE aspirants. We have designed this tutorial after the completion of a deep research about every concept.The content is described in detailed manner and has the ability to answer most of your queries. The tutorial also contains the numerical examples based on previous year GATE questions which will help you to address the problems in a practical manner.Operating System can be defined as an interface between user and the hardware. It provides an environment to the user so that, the user can perform its task in convenient and efficient way.The Operating System Tutorial is divided into various parts based on its functions such as Process Management, Process Synchronization, Deadlocks and File Management.Operating System Definition and FunctionIn the Computer System (comprises of Hardware and software), Hardware can only understand machine code (in the form of 0 and 1) which doesn't make any sense to a naive user.We need a system which can act as an intermediary and manage all the processes and resources present in the system.An Operating System can be defined as an interface between user and hardware. It is responsible for the execution of all the processes, Resource Allocation, CPU management, File Management and many other tasks.The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in convenient and efficient manner.Structure of a Computer SystemA Computer System consists of:Users (people who are using the computer)Application Programs (Compilers, Databases, Games, Video player, Browsers, etc.)System Programs (Shells, Editors, Compilers, etc.)Operating System ( A special program which acts as an interface between user and hardware )Hardware ( CPU, Disks, Memory, etc)What does an Operating system do?Process ManagementProcess SynchronizationMemory ManagementCPU SchedulingFile ManagementSecurityOperating System IndexOperating System TutorialOS TutorialTypes of OSProcess ManagementProcess Management in OSAttributes of a ProcessProcess StatesProcess SchedulersProcess QueuesTimes Related to ProcessCPU SchedulingScheduling AlgorithmsFCFS SchedulingConvoy Effect in FCFSFCFS with overheadSJF SchedulingBurst Time PredictionSRTF schedulingSRTF GATE 2011 ExampleRound Robin SchedulingRR scheduling ExampleHRRN SchedulingHRNN ExamplePriority SchedulingNon Preemptive PriorityPreemptive PrioritySRTF:IO bound processesSynchronizationIntroductionCritical Section ProblemLock Variable MechanismTSL MechanismPriority Inversion in TSLTurn VariableInterested VariablePaterson SolutionWithout Busy WaitingSleep and WakeSemaphore IntroductionCounting SemaphoreProblem on counting semaphoreBinary SemaphoreDeadlocksIntroductionstrategies HandlingDeadlock PreventionDeadlock AvoidanceResource Allocation GraphDetection using RAGDetection and RecoveryMemory ManagementIntroductionFixed PartitioningDynamic PartitioningCompactionBit Map for Dynamic PartitioningLinked List for Dynamic PartitioningPartitioning AlgorithmsGATE on Best Fit & First FitNeed for PagingPaging with ExampleBinary AddressesPhysical & Logical AddressPage TableMapping from page tablePage Table EntryPage Table SizeFinding Optimal Page SizeVirtual MemoryLook aside BufferGATE question on TLBDemand PagingInverted Page TablePage ReplacementGate on LRU and FIFONumerical on LRU, FIFOBeladys AnamolySegmentationPaging VS SegmentationSegmented PagingFile ManagementAttributes of the FileOperations on the FileFile Access MethodsDirectory StructureSingle level DirectoryTwo level DirectoryTree structured DirectoryAcyclic Graph DirectoriesFile SystemFile System StructureMaster Boot RecordOn Disk Data StructuresIn memory Data structuresDirectory ImplementationAllocation MethodsContiguous AllocationLinked List AllocationFile Allocation TableIndexed AllocationLinked Index AllocationInodeFree space ManagementDisk SchedulingFCFS SchedulingSSTF SchedulingSCAN and C-SCANLook and C-LookNumerical on SSTFNumerical on DiskPrerequisitesBefore learning the operating system tutorial, you must have the basic knowledge about the way in which a computer system operates.AudienceOur operating system tutorial is designed to help beginners, professionals and GATE aspirants.ProblemWe can assure you that you will not find any problem in this operating system tutorial.
